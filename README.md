<p align="center">
  <i align="center"> A Comprehensive Configuration Guide for a Bloat-free and Responsive Windows Installation üöÄ</i>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i align="center"><b>Latest Verified Version</b></i>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i align="center">Windows 10 Pro N, version 22H2 [19045.3570] (Updated October 2023)</i>
</p>

<br>

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

<div align="justify">This repository is a virtual public storage space for everything I have managed to track down and use over the years, in my effort of creating, optimizing and maintaining Windows Systems. I run Windows only for the purpose of using Office Products and other non-Linux compatible software. This is <b>not meant to be a universal build</b> and you shoudn't attempt to copy verbatim and expect it to work for you. <b><i>Please consider yourself advised.</i></b></div>

<br>

<div align="justify">This guide is seperated into two main parts. Part 1 relates to ISO Building and Configuration, this you will only have to do all over again with a new ISO, in case you want to reinstall a newer version of Windows, other than that, you should be able to re-use the optimized Windows ISO for as long as your heart desires. Part 2 relates to Post Install, things like what applications to install, what scripts to run, how to maintain your system so it lasts longer etc.</div>

<br>

<h2 align="center">System Requirements</h2>


<p>Requirements</p>

- Webcam & Microphone Support

- Package Managers
  - Scoop
  - Chocolatey
  - Windows Store
  - Winget 

- Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Support
  - WiFi Wireless Card - 

- Compatibillity with Elgato StreamDeck Software

<br>

<h2 align="center">Version Choice</h2>

Why did I choose Windows Pro N?

<h1 align="center">Part 1</h1>
<h2 align="center">Building & Configuring</h2>

### Language Packs

- Greek Language Pack (for Keyboard Layout)

### Fonts

I use [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-3-install-script).  

- https://www.ntlite.com/community/index.php?threads/integrate-add-a-font-to-the-iso-windows-10.2203/

''' PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1'''

### Drivers

This is my current working drivers that I have no problem with, as of the latest release.

- NVIDIA Driver - 

- WiFi & Bluetooth Driver - 

<br>

Plese do use [NVCleanInstall]() when downloading and installing any NVIDIA Drivers. Settings [here]().

### Registry Tweaks

I have compiled a series of registry tweaks from various sources over the years, as well as created a few of my own in my attempt to optimize my user experience. You can find a comphensive detailed list of those [here.] In order to use them, go ahead and download the repository from the [Releases]() and after extracting the files, navigate to Pre-Install > Registry-Files and execute in a live-system or copy-paste the ones you like from each category into a seperate folder, and import them into NTLite.

The tweaks are categorized under Categories and named after their purpose.

Each registry tweak follows the following file formula.

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

; [File_Name AKA What the Registry Tweak does]
; Created by [Author Name] on [File Creation Date] 
; Modified on [Last Modification Date]
; Categorized under [Folder Name AKA Category of Registry Tweak]

; Description of the Setting it changes, what exactly is this feature etc. etc.

; Sources 

; [Link 1 - Bibliography] 
; [Link 2 - Bibliography]

; <------ Registry Edit ------>

Contents of the File.
```

**Before!** you use any tweak(s) ensure you read these comment(s) inside the .reg (labeled with semicolon) to see what it really changes. 
I have tried my best to do exensive reseach on each tweak, but that doesn't mean that subtitutes your own judgment and liabillity.

#### **Please backup your registry before any changes or use a Virtual-Machine or a spare computer. I am not liable for any problems that arise from executing these.**

The tweaks contain **Sources** that have useful information around each individual tweak. Please do open those and do your own research before applying changes to your system.

After you have applied the settings using the registry files, I suggest you go into your registry and verify the changes yourself and/or test the
functionallity it promises.

The [Sources](#Bibliography) where I gathered the plethora of registry tweaks that can be found under this repository, are at the bottom of this file. Enjoy :)

# Services

This is not a <b>Safe Configuration</b> for your System and 
I cannot possibly test all possible configurations extensively!

What I can offer is what ‚Äúworks for me‚Äù and the obstacles I have come across so you do not have to discover them on your own.

Feel free to copy this setup but don't hold me liable for anything that is wrong about it in your individual case.

### System Services

This is a list of services which Microsoft has allowed me to disable succesfully as of this latest release, if a service is not on this list then I am unsure of the impacts it may have on your desktop experience. Be mindful, that I use Wireless connection for my Gaming System, so if you using a wired connection your configuration will vary.

Here's a NTLite Preset that matches this configuration.

### Per-user Services Summary

This is a list of per-user services which I disable. These only prevents the services from being started on login. Per-user services are dynamically created upon creating a user session for example you'll see ContactData service but also see the running service ContactData_37664 (per-user service), each user logged into the system will have their on per user service for those listed below if it is configured to be enabled.

### First Boot Scripts

If you ever looked at custom versions of Windows, you might be familiar with something described as playbooking, a series of rules and scripts running on your system to provide the same experience every time, I have done something similar here, by adding a batch of scripts into a folder and have them on the first boot of each new system. Just run the <i>run_all_scripts.bat</i> and you good to go.

A detailed catalog of all the scripts running is to be found [here.]

Customize your execution catalog, by deleting scripts you don't want to run from the file structure.

<h1 align="center">Part 2</h1>

<div align="center">Having reached this far, you should now have a Live System.</div> 
<br>

<div>From now on, this repository is geared towards keeping this live setup as bloat-free and as consistently performant as possible over the long haul. Keep in mind, that my advice is for you to reinstall a new Windows every 3 to 6 months and re-do this whole thing, there are many automated ways to save your configuration and re-apply them, and having a second hard drive which you considently keep your important files should make this easier for you.</div>

My preferences include mostly Open-Source community maintained software, in case no software of that sort serves my purpose, I opt for commerical or closed-source alternatives.

### System Security

As far as Antivirus software goes, I wouldn't trust any free-option out there, if you want to buy one, go with Sophos, that's just my personal preference, it has high capture rates and had most success with it, a mix of MalwareBytes and SimpleWall does it for me, as I don't use this system to browse a lot.

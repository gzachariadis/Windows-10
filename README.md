  <i align="center"><b>Latest Verified Version</b></i>

<h1 align="center">Windows ISO Building and Tweaking (Pre-Install)</h1>

<div align="center">This repository is a virtual storage space for everything I have managed to track down and use over the years, in my effort of creating, optimizing and maintaining Windows Systems. I run Windows only for the purpose of using Office Products and other non-Linux compatible software. This is <b>not meant to be a universal build</b> and you shoudn't attempt to copy verbatim and expect it to work for you. Please consider yourself advised.</div>

<br>

<div align="center">This guide is seperated into two main parts. Part 1 relates to ISO Building and Configuration, this you will only have to do all over again with a new ISO, in case you want to reinstall a newer version of Windows, other than that, you should be able to re-use the optimized Windows ISO for as long as your heart desires. Part 2 relates to Post Install, things like what applications to install, what scripts to run, how to maintain your system so it last longer etc.</div>

<br>

<h1 align="center">System Requirements</h1>

<p align="center">
  <i align="center">This is a list of requirements that I have for my systems. I happen to use a WiFi Wireless Card for my Computer and a Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse and a Microphone, if you're requirements are different, please act accordingly. </i>
</p>
<br>
<p>Requirements</p>

- Webcam & Microphone Support

- Winget & Microsoft Store Compatibillity

### Language Packs

- Greek Language Pack (for Keyboard Layout)

### Fonts

I use [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-3-install-script).  

- https://www.ntlite.com/community/index.php?threads/integrate-add-a-font-to-the-iso-windows-10.2203/

''' PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1'''

### Drivers

This is my current working drivers that I have no problem with, as of the latest release.

## Registry Tweaks

Each registry tweak follows the following file formula.

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

; [File_Name AKA What the Registry Tweak does]
; Created by [Author Name] on [File Creation Date] 
; Modified on [Last Modification Date]
; Categorized under [Folder Name AKA Category of Registry Tweak]

; Description of the Setting it changes, what exactly is this feature etc. etc.

; Sources 

; [Link 1 - Bibliography] 
; [Link 2 - Bibliography]

; <------ Registry Edit ------>

Contents of the File.
```

I have tried my best to do exensive reseach on each tweak.

**Before!** you use any tweak(s) ensure you read these comment(s) inside the .reg (labeled with semicolon) to see what it really changes. 

#### **Please backup your registry before any changes or use a Virtual-Machine or a spare computer. I am not liable for any problems that arise from executing these.**

The tweaks contain **Sources** that have useful information around each individual tweak. Please do open those and do your own research before applying changes to your system.

After you have applied the settings using the registry files, I suggest you go into your registry and verify the changes yourself and/or test the
functionallity it promises.

The [Sources](#Bibliography) where I gathered the plethora of registry tweaks that can be found under this repository, are at the bottom of this file. Enjoy :)

# Services

This is not a <b>Safe Configuration</b> for your System and 
I cannot possibly test all possible configurations extensively!

What I can offer is what “works for me” and the obstacles I have come across so you do not have to discover them on your own.

Feel free to copy this setup but don't hold me liable for anything that is wrong about it in your individual case.

### System Services

This is a list of services which Microsoft has allowed me to disable succesfully as of this latest release, if a service is not on this list then I am unsure of the impacts it may have on your desktop experience. Be mindful, that I use Wireless connection for my Gaming System, so if you using a wired connection your configuration will vary.

<br>



<br>

Here's a NTLite Preset that matches this configuration.

### Per-user Services Summary

This is a list of per-user services which I disable. These only prevents the services from being started on login. Per-user services are dynamically created upon creating a user session for example you'll see ContactData service but also see the running service ContactData_37664 (per-user service), each user logged into the system will have their on per user service for those listed below if it is configured to be enabled.

# Post-Setup Scripts

<h1 align="center">Part 2 - Windows Live Install (Post-Install)</h1>

<div align="center">Having reached this far, you should now have a Live System.</div> 
<br>

<div>From now on, this repository is geared towards keeping this live setup as bloat-free and as consistently performant as possible over the long haul. Keep in mind, that my advice is for you to reinstall a new Windows every 3 to 6 months and re-do this whole thing, there are many automated ways to save your configuration and re-apply them, and having a second hard drive which you considently keep your important files should make this easier for you.</div>

## Applications

This is the list of Applications Categories, that I personally prefer to have on my Windows Systems, they are seperated by "Purpose". In some occasions, popular alternatives are proposed for you.

You can use the [Winget Client](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) and [Winutil by Chris Titus] to issue an automated install.

## Categories 

### Drivers & Controller

- [Snappy Driver Installer]()
- [NVCleanInstall]()

These two might differ depending on your hardware.

- [MSI AfterBurner]()
- [iCUE]()

### System Security

As far as Antivirus software goes, I wouldn't trust any free-option out there, if you want to buy one, go with Sophos, that's just my personal preference, it has high capture rates and had most success with it, a mix of MalwareBytes and SimpleWall does it for me, as I don't use this system to browse a lot.

- [MalwareBytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/)
- [SimpleWall](https://www.henrypp.org/product/simplewall) or [TinyWall](https://tinywall.pados.hu/)

#### User.js Configuration 

The Firefox user.js file stores user settings, the file is loaded each time Firefox starts. This a convenient way to save your browser customizations and apply them on different machines - for a more technical breakdown and explanation, you can read more in the Firefox Wiki.

I used the sources below to create my [user.js.](Post-Install/Application%20Files/user.js)
Please don't apply it blindly and produce your own research on what settings you want applied in your browser.

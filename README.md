<div>This repository is used as a virtual storage space for everything I have managed to track down and use over the years, in my effort of creating, optimizing and maintaining my Gaming System. My main goal is to keep my System working as optimally as possible, and remove anything extra out of Windows 10. This is not meant to be a universal build you will copy verbatim and have it work for you. This is also not, a tweaked operating system you can use for anything else but <b>Gaming</b>.</div>
<br>
<div>This took me a while to compile, work on, and test, so feel free to leave a star if you felt it's useful or helped you in any way.</div>

## Requirements

- Webcam Support

- Microphone Support

- Nvidia Drivers (Control Panel included)

- DirectX

## Language Packs

- Greek Language Pack (for Keyboard Layout)

## Drivers

The only drivers, I have ever had problems with on my system was NVIDIA Drivers and Bluetooth Compatibillity. I could write the plethora of issues, I have come across, but I won't bore you.

<br>

This is my current working drivers that I have no problem with, as of the latest release.

- NVIDIA Driver : 

- WiFi & Bluetooth Driver : 

## Registry Tweaks

Each registry tweak follows the following file formula.

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

; [File_Name AKA What the Registry Tweak does]
; Created by [Author Name] on [File Creation Date] 
; Modified on [Last Modification Date]
; Categorized under [Folder Name AKA Category of Registry Tweak]

; Description of the Setting it changes, what exactly is this feature etc. etc.

; Sources 

; [Link 1 - Bibliography] 
; [Link 2 - Bibliography]

; <------ Registry Edit ------>

Contents of the File.
```

I have tried my best to do exensive reseach on each tweak.

**Before!** you use any tweak(s) ensure you read these comment(s) inside the .reg (labeled with semicolon) to see what it really changes. 

#### **Please backup your registry before any changes or use a Virtual-Machine or a spare computer. I am not liable for any problems that arise from executing these.**

The tweaks contain **Sources** that have useful information around each individual tweak. Please do open those and do your own research before applying changes to your system.

After you have applied the settings using the registry files, I suggest you go into your registry and verify the changes yourself and/or test the
functionallity it promises.

The [Sources](#Bibliography) where I gathered the plethora of registry tweaks that can be found under this repository, are at the bottom of this file. Enjoy :)

# Services

This is not a <b>Safe Configuration</b> for your System and 
I cannot possibly test all possible configurations extensively!

What I can offer is what “works for me” and the obstacles I have come across so you do not have to discover them on your own.

Feel free to copy this setup but don't hold me liable for anything that is wrong about it in your individual case.

### System Services

This is a list of services which Microsoft has allowed me to disable succesfully as of this latest release, if a service is not on this list then I am unsure of the impacts it may have on your desktop experience. Be mindful, that I use Wireless connection for my Gaming System, so if you using a wired connection your configuration will vary.

<br>



<br>

Here's a NTLite Preset that matches this configuration.

### Per-user Services Summary

This is a list of per-user services which I disable. These only prevents the services from being started on login. Per-user services are dynamically created upon creating a user session for example you'll see ContactData service but also see the running service ContactData_37664 (per-user service), each user logged into the system will have their on per user service for those listed below if it is configured to be enabled.

### Browsers

I am against installing Chrome on your gaming system, I don't go online on it much other than gaming, it's a bit like a gaming console, but if you have to have a Chrome-like browser on it, I suggest [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/).

#### LibreWolf vs Firefox

I propose you use a Hardened version of  to get online when using your Gaming System, considering this system is stripped from most of the security (eg. Windows Defender, Windows Updates, Windows Firewall etc.), your browser is the most crucial defense you have. 

- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/)

#### User.js Configuration 

The Firefox user.js file stores user settings, the file is loaded each time Firefox starts. This a convenient way to save your browser customizations and apply them on different machines - for a more technical breakdown and explanation, you can read more in the Firefox Wiki.

I used the sources below to create my [user.js.](Post-Install/Application%20Files/user.js)
Please don't apply it blindly and produce your own research on what settings you want applied in your browser.

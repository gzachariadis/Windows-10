# Registry Tweaks

I have tried to do Extensive Research on each Registry Tweak and introduce comments on what exactly each tweak does. 

**Before!** you use any tweak(s) ensure you read the comment(s) inside the .reg (labeled with semicolon) to see what it really changes. 

#### **Please backup your registry before any changes or use a Virtual-Machine or a spare computer. I am not liable for any problems that arise from executing these.**

The tweaks contain **Sources** that have useful information around each individual tweak. Please do open those and do your own research before applying changes to your system.

On that note, feel free to open issues about inaccurate information you may find, or to add more registry tweaks, as I am always on the look-out for new ones.

The [Sources](#Bibliography) where I gathered registry tweaks that can be found under this repository, are at the bottom of this file.

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

<div align="justify">This repository is a virtual public storage space for everything I have managed to track down and use over the years, in my effort of creating, optimizing and maintaining Windows Systems. I run Windows only for the purpose of using Office Products and other non-Linux compatible software. This is <b>not meant to be a universal build</b> and you shoudn't attempt to copy verbatim and expect it to work for you. <b><i>Please consider yourself advised.</i></b></div>

<br>

<div align="justify">This guide is seperated into two main parts. Part 1 relates to ISO Building and Configuration, this you will only have to do all over again with a new ISO, in case you want to reinstall a newer version of Windows, other than that, you should be able to re-use the optimized Windows ISO for as long as your heart desires. Part 2 relates to Post Install, things like what applications to install, what scripts to run, how to maintain your system so it lasts longer etc.</div>

So let's talk ISO configuriments, you will need to download an official ISO from Microsoft. Do that now by using this [link]() or going and fetching one for you by Googling it.

Secondly, you will need [MSMG Toolkit]() and [NTLite]() the second one is a tool you will need to pay for, there's a free version, never used it so I don't know what features, it's missing.

#### Post-Setup


### Fonts

I use [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-3-install-script).  

- https://www.ntlite.com/community/index.php?threads/integrate-add-a-font-to-the-iso-windows-10.2203/

''' PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1'''

### Drivers

This is my current working drivers that I have no problem with, as of the latest release.

- NVIDIA Driver - 

- WiFi & Bluetooth Driver - 

<br>

Plese do use [NVCleanInstall]() when downloading and installing any NVIDIA Drivers. Settings [here]().

### Registry Tweaks

I have compiled a series of registry tweaks from various sources over the years, as well as created a few of my own in my attempt to optimize my user experience. You can find a comphensive detailed list of those [here.] In order to use them, go ahead and download the repository from the [Releases]() and after extracting the files, navigate to Pre-Install > Registry-Files and execute in a live-system or copy-paste the ones you like from each category into a seperate folder, and import them into NTLite.

The tweaks are categorized under Categories and named after their purpose.

Each registry tweak follows the following file formula.

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

; [File_Name AKA What the Registry Tweak does]
; Created by [Author Name] on [File Creation Date] 
; Modified on [Last Modification Date]
; Categorized under [Folder Name AKA Category of Registry Tweak]

; Description of the Setting it changes, what exactly is this feature etc. etc.

; Sources 

; [Link 1 - Bibliography] 
; [Link 2 - Bibliography]

; <------ Registry Edit ------>

Contents of the File.
```

**Before!** you use any tweak(s) ensure you read these comment(s) inside the .reg (labeled with semicolon) to see what it really changes. 
I have tried my best to do exensive reseach on each tweak, but that doesn't mean that subtitutes your own judgment and liabillity.

#### **Please backup your registry before any changes or use a Virtual-Machine or a spare computer. I am not liable for any problems that arise from executing these.**

The tweaks contain **Sources** that have useful information around each individual tweak. Please do open those and do your own research before applying changes to your system.

After you have applied the settings using the registry files, I suggest you go into your registry and verify the changes yourself and/or test the
functionallity it promises.

The [Sources](#Bibliography) where I gathered the plethora of registry tweaks that can be found under this repository, are at the bottom of this file. Enjoy :)

### System Services

This is a list of services which Microsoft has allowed me to disable succesfully as of this latest release, if a service is not on this list then I am unsure of the impacts it may have on your desktop experience. Be mindful, that I use Wireless connection for my Gaming System, so if you using a wired connection your configuration will vary.

Here's a NTLite Preset that matches this configuration.

### First Boot Scripts

If you ever looked at custom versions of Windows, you might be familiar with something described as playbooking, a series of rules and scripts running on your system to provide the same experience every time, I have done something similar here, by adding a batch of scripts into a folder and have them on the first boot of each new system. Just run the <i>run_all_scripts.bat</i> and you good to go.

A detailed catalog of all the scripts running is to be found [here.]

Customize your execution catalog, by deleting scripts you don't want to run from the file structure.

<h1 align="center">Part 2</h1>
<h3 align="center">Windows Live System</h3> 
<br>

<div align="justify">Having reached this far, you should now have a Live System. From now on, this repository is geared towards keeping this live setup as bloat-free and as consistently performant as possible over the long haul. Keep in mind, that my advice is for you to reinstall a new Windows every 3 to 6 months and re-do this whole thing, there are many automated ways to save your configuration and re-apply them, and having a second hard drive which you considently keep your important files should make this easier for you.</div>

<br>

FIrst things, first, let's install the required Package Managers.

### [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
```

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

### [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

```
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
```

## Drivers

- [Snappy Driver Installer]()
- [NVCleanInstall]()

These two might differ depending on your hardware.

- [MSI AfterBurner]()
- [iCUE]()

## Windows Updates

<div align="justify">In terms of Windows Updates, when I happen to install a new system or want to manually update my system, my favorite option is [this executable by Slavanap](https://github.com/slavanap/Windows10ManualUpdate/releases/download/1.03/w10mu.exe). This is a fantastic small tool that allows for manually selecting which updates to install and takes care of the installation for me.</div>

#### Windows Update Policy

<div align="justify">I set my police to Security Settings <b>ONLY!</b> this delays feature updates by 2 years and will install security updates 4 days after release. I use [Win Util by Chris Titus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil/releases/download/24.06.11/winutil.ps1) to set those policies automatically.</div>

## Debloating & Optimizing

<div align="justify">The following tools, are able to help you optimize and debloat your system, but first there's a list of applications that any Windows ISO doesn't allow to be removed when installing it. You can safely uninstall them now though...</div>

- Sticky Notes
- Xbox apps
- Your Phone
- Microsoft Pay

<div align="justify">Additionally, you should run the following [executable by ShadowWhisperer](https://github.com/ShadowWhisperer/Remove-MS-Edge/blob/main/Remove-EdgeOnly.exe?raw=true), this removed only the Edge browser, while leaving the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime, which is essential for the Microsoft Store to function. Bare in mind that I have never paid and installed non-free applications from the Windows Store, you simply have to test this functionality on your own.</div>

### [Optimizer](https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer/releases/download/16.5/Optimizer-16.5.exe)

#### Configuration

#### System Security

<div align="justify">As far as Antivirus software goes, I wouldn't trust any free-option out there, if you want to buy one, go with Sophos, that's just my personal preference, it has high capture rates and had most success with it, a mix of MalwareBytes and SimpleWall does it for me, as I don't use this system to browse a lot.</div>

### Tiling Window Manager

A window manager is an application that manages open Windows. I happen to use [Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi).

Install it by following these steps, open a Powershell Administrator Window, and execute

```
Set-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem' -Name 'LongPathsEnabled' -Value 1
```

<div align="justify">Disabling unnecessary system animations, it is highly recommended that you enable the <i>"Turn off all unnecessary animations (when possible)" option in "Control Panel > Ease of Access > Ease of Access Centre / Make the computer easier to see"</i> for the best performance with komorebi.</div>

Now in an non-administrator window, execute the following...

```
scoop install git
```

```
scoop bucket add extras
```

```
scoop install komorebi autohotkey
```

#### Configuration

Run this command to make sure that the directory has been created

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/komorebi
```

Run this command to open up your PowerShell profile configuration in Notepad++ 

```
Start notepad++ $PROFILE
```

Add this line (with your login user!) to the bottom of your PowerShell profile configuration

```
$Env:KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME = 'C:\Users\{your username}\.config\komorebi'
```

Reload the changes and then reload the PowerShell profile

```
. $PROFILE
```

Now you can copy my configuration by [downloading it here.]() and place it into the folder we setup.

#### Optional Settings

Start Komorebi with each Windows Startup using the following...

```
komorebic enable-autostart
```

Developer Notes - 
This is developped for the 64 bit version of League Of Legends, so if you are on older hardware it may or may not work. This will bypass Riots Anti Alt F4 they have implemented, as well if you are currently experiencing the NEW BUG on 10.22 where your computer will freeze after game ends or your client does, this can fix that as well. Just make sure you ALT F4 prior to your game ending.. so when the nexus is just about to go RIP.

As for people wanting to understand how this works, basically AHK (Auto Hot Key). The program hooks your keyboard so it can send keypresses on your behave, then I told the application to detect the "League of Legends" process on the computer and if the program is at the front of your computer (Like the thing you are currently tabbed into/using.. etc etc.)  If those two conditions are met, then it monitors to see if the keys "ALT+F4" are pressed at the same time, and if they are then it will immediately terminiate the "League of Legends" process and that is all.

If league of legends is not at the front or you are tabbed out into another program or application pressing ALT+F4 will work like normal. (it will close out of whatever you have open.)

Q: Is this a virus?

A: No, and if you don't believe me you can download the AHK source yourself and compile it. I just have the exe version to make it easier for those whom do not know how to.

A: Yes you can! You could do almost any combination of keys, you could download the source yourself and edit it or contact me on discord if you need help.

A: No, Riot's anticheat team is smart enough to detect a game assisting macro vs a simple program closing one. | Hello Phil & Matt ;)

## FAQ
**Q:** When do you update the services file 'BlackViper.csv'?   
**A:** Due to BlackViper no longer releasing service configurations, the 'BlackViper.csv' will no longer be updated unless, it is for a bug fix or someone else releases a good service configuration.   
**Note:** If you find a good configuration please contact me with link (Contact Info is bellow)   

**Q:** The script file looks all messy in notepad, How do I view it?   
**A:** Try using wordpad or what I recommend, Notepad++ [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) 

**Q:** Do you accept any donations?   
**A:** If you would like to donate to me Please pick an item/giftcard from my amazon wishlist or Contact me about donating, Thanks. BTW The giftcard amount can be changed to a min of $1.   
**Wishlist:** [https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/YBAYWBJES5DE/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/YBAYWBJES5DE/)  

**Q:** Are You or Black Viper the developer?   
**A:** [Black Viper](http://www.blackviper.com/) is the creator of the service configuration. I am the developer of the script and the blackviper.csv file the script uses.   

**Q:** I have a suggestion/Issue for the script, how do I suggest it?   
**A:** Do a pull request with the change or submit it as an issue with the suggestion.   

**Q:** How can I contact you?  
**A:** You can also PM me on reddit or email me  
         1. reddit /u/madbomb122 [https://www.reddit.com/user/madbomb122](https://www.reddit.com/user/madbomb122)

**Note** Before contacting me, please make sure you have ALL the needed files and the size is right (Look above under requirements).   

**Q:** Can I run the script on newer/older builds then indicated?   
**A:** Yes/No, you will get a build check error.. It just wont change any new services (if any) and any default services settings changed from will set incorrectly. So to be on the safe side encase you want to revert to the default make a backup of your services with the script.   

**Q:** *BLAH* isn't working after I used your script.  
**A:** Check over what services were changed and make sure it isn't tied to your issue.   
**Example** `WlanSvc` is disabled when using safe/tweaked on desktops (but not laptops/tables). This service is needed for wifi on your computer.   

**Q:** Can I use a Backup File(s) on another computer?   
**A:** You can use/load them on another computer, but be careful.   
**Note** I would NOT use the reg file on another computer, since it may not all the same services.   

**Q:** The script wont run, can you help me?   
**A:** Yes, but first if you are using automation.. turn off automation and see if it gives and error that you can correct.   

**Q:** Please E-Mail me or Post an Issue, if you are getting an Edition error when running Home/Pro?   
**A:** Please Provide the information the screen give, Until then use -secp (for Pro) or -sech (for Home), Thanks.

**Q:** The script window closes or gives an error saying script is blocked, what do I do?   
**A:** By default windows blocks ps1 scripts, you can use one of the following   
         1. Use the bat file to run the script (recommended)   
         2. On an admin powershell console `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`   	 

**Q:** Why does you script not change the service *BLAH*?   
**A:** You didnt select the All option, it's not a default windows service, cant be changed, or some other good reason.

**Q:** I have an issue with the script, what do I do?   
**A:** Post it as an issue using github's issues tab up top.

**Q:** Can I run the script safely?   
**A:** Yes/No, it's safe to change the services back to default. Using the Safe or Tweaked option may cause problems for program(s) that depends on one of those services.

**Q:** Can I run the script repeatedly?   
**A:** Yes, with same or different settings.

**Q:** I've run the script and it did *BLAH*, can I undo it?   
**A:** Yes, run the script again and select again or load the backup configuration (if you made one).

**Q:** Are you going to add support for builds before the "Creator's Update"?   
**A:** Sorry, since I dont have Black Viper's configuration from before the "Creator's Update" I can't add it. You can use the configuration for Creator's Update, but at your own risk of possible issues.   
**Note:** If you have Black Viper's configuration for pre-Creator's update please contact me, thanks.

**Q:** Will you make a script for any windows before windows 10?   
**A:** No.   

**Q:** What do the letters mean in the release tab after the version number?   
**A:** The letter indicates that something other than the script was updated when the script version hasn't changed..    
**Note:** `B = Bat file`, `S = Service file`, `M = Misc or Multiple Changes`    

**Q:** Can I download the csv file from Black Viper's website and use that?
